Hello,
This DLL and the associated installation script install an icon on your desktop that
will return some statistics on the objects droped upon it:
Smallest file (name and size),
Biggest File (name and file),
Total number of files,
Total space (used and allocated).

As the basic Folder structure in the WPS doesn't give such statistics, I found it very
handy to have such an object on your screen (if you use the WPS heavily, and don't want
to spend on add on programs).

In Order to install, just unzip the program and start the 'filestat.cmd' file.

This installation will put the DLL into your 'OS2\DLL' directory,
edit the script to specify another one (by changing the system_dll variable).

Once installed on your desktop, just select any object (Folders, even several ones at a time, individual files, or any combination , including shadows), and drag-and-drop them onto this
icon, et voila.

This is my first attempt at SOM and OS/2 programming, I welcome any suggestion
or enhancement. You can send a letter to the address below (ghassan's one), or
leave a message on the OS/2 REXX, WPS, and PRG echoes on fidonet (I got no
access to CIS, way too expensive).
